The portfolio highlights the developerâ€™s skills, projects, and contact information in a visually appealing and interactive manner. The particles effect adds an engaging and dynamic visual element to the website, creating a modern and creative touch to the design. Existing resources such as React Bootstrap components and Particle.js (or a similar library) are used to accelerate development and enhance the user experience.
